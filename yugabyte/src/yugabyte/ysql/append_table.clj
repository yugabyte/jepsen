(ns yugabyte.ysql.append-table
  "Values are lists of integers. Each operation performs a transaction,
  comprised of micro-operations which are either reads of some value (returning
  the entire list) or appends (adding a single number to whatever the present
  value of the given list is). We detect cycles in these transactions using
  Jepsen's cycle-detection system.

  Lists are encoded as rows in a table; key names are table names, and the set
  of all rows determines the list contents.

  This test requires a way to order table contents, and as far as I can tell,
  there's no safe, transactional way to order inserts in YB. SERIAL columns
  aren't actually ordered; we can't use txn begin times (e.g. NOW()) because
  they might not reflect commit orders, and there's no way to get (presently)
  txn commit times. We can use COUNT(*), but that reads the whole table... Not
  sure what to do here."
